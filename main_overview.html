<b>System of People</b>

culture and nuances of the information services support business. And,

<b>System of Processes</B><br>
<BR>
At TEKsystems, we know our people make the difference. And we make every
possible effort to be sure that the people we hire are the people you want
-- and the valuable resources you need.
<BR>
<BR>
We also know that with the right processes in place, our people are at
their best, whether they∆re on your account team or your implementation
team. Our significant investment in developing internal processes to
streamline our business operations strengthens our service delivery.   
<BR>
<BR>
Results begin with our account teams and the ability to offer the right
type of scalable services. Dedicated to overseeing and anticipating your
short-term and long-term needs, we leverage the real-world knowledge and
hands-on experiences of our specialists in technology, project management,
budgeting, recruiting, and support. We then build your implementation team
based upon your specific delivery requirements.
<BR>
<BR>
Throughout every service engagement, your account team is measured by your
satisfaction. So we give all our people powerful support systems.  Systems
that are designed to help them achieve the highest level of success for
themselves and for each and every client. We∆ve built a strong IS training
program for our technicians and technical support specialists, with
advanced classroom exercises that span areas such as troubleshooting,
diagnostics, problem resolution, communication skills and technical
certification. We∆ve built a Virtual Support Center that lets all our
people benefit from the experience of our entire team.
<BR>
<BR>
Our commitment to quality processes drives every aspect of our
organization. Our goal is to deliver quality at every point of contact.
Because we strive for this, we know that we can confidently stand behind
every person we hire and every service we offer -- and always hold
ourselves accountable for the results we deliver. We can∆t afford not to,
because that∆s what keeps us in business.
<BR>
<BR>
But we don∆t stop with technical training. Because we commit to our people
for the long term, we commit to their personal growth. We provide our
technical people with professional and personal development. We know that
when we∆re supporting end users, quality service and a professional
attitude are paramount. We∆ve built a team that we can count on, so you
can count on us.
